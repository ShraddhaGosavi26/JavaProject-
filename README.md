QuickIQ - Quiz 
A straightforward quiz application built in Java that operates in the command line. It presents users with multiple-choice questions, prompts them to select answers, and checks for correctness. The app keeps track of the user's score and provides performance feedback at the end of the quiz. Leveraging core Java concepts and the collection framework, this project demonstrates effective use of data structures to manage questions and answers efficiently
